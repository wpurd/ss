                            	<h2>3D Printing Technologies</h2>
                            	3D Printing technologies offer transformative advantages at every statge of the product development life cycle. The small size, eas of operation and high speed of the 3D Printing process reduces time-to-build and facilitiates innovation and experimentation. Also known as additive manufacturing, 3D Printing provices freedom and flexibility from conventional manufacturing methods. SourcSync uses the processes below for rapid modeling, prototyping and production of end-use parts.
                            </p>	
                          	<h3>Additive Manufacturing</h3>
                            <p>
                                The next generation of manufacturing.
                            </p>
                            <p>   
								While traditional manufacturing methods turn raw materials into product, Additive Manufacturing builds your product from the ground up by depositing layers of sintered metal or plastic. With Additive Manufacturing, producing complex parts in production ready materials takes days instead of weeks. From prototype to production, NextLine's Additive Manufacturing technology will help reduce your time to market and production costs.
                            <h3>A Flexible Soution for Complex Parts</h3>
                            <p>
                            	Additive Manufacturing technologies provide incredible advantages over traditional manufacturing and machining techniques. Rather than removing material to create a product or prototype, NextLine produces parts by printing your design layer by layer. This offers unparalleled precision and replaces the need for expensive multi-axis machining. NextLine provides the easiest and fastest way to turn a 3D CAD design into a production-ready part.
                             </p>
								
							<p>	
								<h3>FDM</h3>
								Fused Deposition Modeling: Like most other additive fabrication processes (such as 3D printing and stereolithography) FDM works on an "additive" principle by laying down material in layers. A plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow. The nozzle is heated to melt the material and can be moved in both horizontal and vertical directions by a numerically controlled mechanism, directly controlled by a computer-aided design software package. The model or part is produced by extruding small beads of thermoplastic material to from layers as the material hardens immediately after extrusion from the nozzle.

								Several materials are available with different trade-offs between strength and temperature properties. As well as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer, the FDM technology can also be used with polycarbonates, polycaprolactone, polyphenylsulfones and waxes.
							</p>		
							<p>	
								<h3>Objet</h3>
								Objet: The PolyJet process provides fine detail and surface finish in prototypes and manufactured parts. In a process similar to ink jetting, liquid photo polymer resin is jetted out in fine layers to build a model. The layers measure only 16 microns (0.0006 in.) which results in a superior surface finish smoothness.

								The materials are jetted in ultra-thin layers onto a build tray, layer by layer, until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured by UV light immediately after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing.

								It offers the completely unique ability to print parts and assemblies made of multiple model materials, with different mechanical or physical properties, all in a single build. Taking the revolution even further!

								Printing with Digital Materials allows you to print parts with specific Shore A values to match the values of the intended production materials. This capability opens up new opportunities, bringing you much closer to realizing the final product at an early stage, including feasibility testing and over-molding process simulation.
							</p>		
							<p>
								<h3>Z-Corp</h3>
								Z-Corp: Is a process where a plaster or starch based powder is spread out in layers from .0035" to .005" in thickness and the layers are bonded by cyanoacrolyte and ink for color. These models can be printed in monochromatic or in multiple colors at one time to produce a like-finished look for marketing models in just a few hours. The colors can be chosen in most CAD software and are exported with the model when saved as a VRML file. This process is very fast, and relatively inexpensive compared to the other processes, but may not provide the strength or flexibility of the others.
							</p>	
							<p>
								<h3>Urethane Castings</h3>
								Urethane Castings: To start the mold making process, a master pattern is needed; it can be a part you supply, or a stereolithography prototype that has been finished. The master pattern is coated in a silicone-based liquid rubber. Once the liquid hardens, the master pattern is removed, and the void left behind is injected with a urethane casting material that best fits your material requirements. Using this process, several copies, or urethane castings, can be made of the initial prototype.
                            </p>
                            <p>	
                                <h3>SLA</h3>
								StereoLithography: Is an additive fabrication process utilizing a vat of liquid UV-curable photo-polymer "resin" and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin. Exposure to the UV laser light cures, or, solidifies the pattern traced on the resin and adheres it to the layer below.

								After a pattern has been traced, the SLA's elevator platform descends by a single layer thickness, typically 0.05 mm to 0.15 mm (0.002" to 0.006"). Then, a resin-filled blade sweeps across the part cross section, re-coating it with fresh material. On this new liquid surface the subsequent layer pattern is traced, adhering to the previous layer. A complete 3-D part is formed by this process. After building, parts are cleaned of excess resin by immersion in a chemical bath and then cured in a UV oven.
							</p>
							<p>	
								<h3>SLS</h3>
								Selective Laser Sintering: Is an additive rapid manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.

								SLS can produce parts from a relatively wide range of commercially available powder materials, including polymers (nylon, also glass-filled or with other fillers, and polystyrene), metals (steel, titanium, alloy mixtures, and composites) and green sand.

								<h3>Vacuum Casting</h3>
								Besides additive techniques, Materialise offers another type of Rapid Prototyping: manufacture of components and small series in silicone molds. Vacuum casting lead times are a bit longer than with 3D Printing technology but the result is astounding. Products made in silicone molds have a quality comparable to the final product, which makes them especially suitable for fit and function testing and marketing purposes.

								The method uses cast silicone molds made as follows: a master model (that typically originates from stereolithography or selective laser sintering) is carefully prepared to ensure a high quality finish to the surface and the definition of the parting planes. Silicone is cast around the master, partially under vacuum in order to avoid air bubbles being trapped in between the master and silicone. After curing, the mold is cut according to the parting planes and the master is removed, leaving a cavity to make copies. The flexibility of the silicone allows limited undercuts, which might avoid slides or additional parting planes.
							</p>	
							<p>		
								Two-component polyurethanes are typically used as copying material. This allows fast production of high quality parts. Vacuum casting is a copying technique typically used for the production of small series (10 to 20) of functional plastic prototypes.

								While traditional manufacturing methods turn raw materials into product, Additive Manufacturing builds your product from the ground up by depositing layers of sintered metal or plastic. With Additive Manufacturing, producing complex parts in production ready materials takes days instead of weeks. From prototype to production, SourcSync's Additive Manufacturing technology will help reduce your time to market and production costs.
                            <h3>A Flexible Soution for Complex Parts</h3>
                            <p>
                            	Additive Manufacturing technologies provide incredible advantages over traditional manufacturing and machining techniques. Rather than removing material to create a product or prototype, SourceSync produces parts by printing your design layer by layer. This offers unparalleled precision and replaces the need for expensive multi-axis machining. SourceSync provides the easiest and fastest way to turn a 3D CAD design into a production-ready part.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            	The CNC Machining process can be broken down into three steps:
                            </p>
                            <p>
								Step 1: 3D CAD files are analyzed to determine the fixturing required and the most cost effective method to machine the part.
							</p>	
							<p>	
								Step 2: Machine code for fixtures and the manufacturing of the part is generated using Mastercam software.
							</p>
							<p>	
								Step 3: The product is then manufactured to the customer’s dimensional and surface finish specifications using high speed, precision CNC machining equipment and tools.

                            <p>   
								When it comes to testing real production prototypes, there is simply no substitute for injection molded parts. Traditional machining often requires multiple processes to produce components with complex geometries and intricate construction. SourcSync rapid injection molding eliminates the need for these costly and time-consuming methods by producing a single mold for complex, precision parts that would be too costly to machine. SourceSync is the quickest and easiest way for you to create injection molded parts for prototyping, initial runs and low-volume production. No part is too big, too small or too complicated.
                            
                            <h3>Custom Injection Molded Parts in 15 Days</h3>

                                        <p>
                                            Selection of the proper material is crucial to part production. Designers should consider the mechanical characteristics, molding properties and cost of the resin used.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Application-specific requirements will always drive the need for particular material properties like tensile strength, impact resistance or ductility.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Successful designs for injection-molded parts are also built on an understanding of process-related issues such as the ability to fill the mold, tendency to flash, ease of part ejection, and the potential for warp, sink or void creation. Part geometry can be used to help address some of these issues, but just as material properties are an important factor in meeting the requirements of a given application, they should also be considered to ensure the moldability of the part.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Generally, any conventionally injection-moldable material can be specified. If the material is relatively standard, and we don't have it in stock, there may be an extra charge for us to procure a minimum quantity. Delivery could also be affected if the material is not readily available from the resin distributors. We are happy to work with specific resins that you already use and would like to supply to us.
