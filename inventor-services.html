                            <p>
                                There are plenty of people who have great invention ideas running around in their heads that have the potential of being great. However, most of them do not do anything about the invention idea they have. Some do something to a limited degree but never pursue it to its full fruition. To turn your new invention idea into something and into the hands of consumers, you have to follow some basic steps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            	When you have an invention idea, the first thing you need to worry about is protection. There are many unscrupulous parties out there that would copy your idea and reap the rewards if they can.
                            </p>	
                            <p>
                            	Your first action to protect as well as validate your idea is to start the patent process. Not only is this good for your own protection, it will also show companies that you are serious about your invention. The road to the market is a long and bumpy road. From the initial idea concept to the shelves on the store exists a myriad of obstacles. It can be costly to try to navigate this process on your own. SourceSync is a team of highly skilled marketing professionals who evaluate the potential of your invention idea and guide you in moving forward to a money making consumer product invention.

                            <h3>Patent Searching</h3>
                            <h4>What is a patent search?</h4>
                            <p>
								A patent search is performed for the purpose of finding the most relevant existing U.S. Patents and published U.S. Patents to your invention (referred to as “prior art”) and is typically conducted in the early stages of the application process by an independent patent search firm.
							</p>
							<h4>Why is a patent search important?</h4>
                            <p>
								A patent search of all existing U.S. Patents can provide excellent information to help an inventor make a decision on whether or not to move forward with an idea. The search is primarily focused on determining whether a patent on a similar invention has already been issued or published with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Although patent searching is a valuable step in the process, it is important to understand that it can never guarantee with certainty that your invention will or will not be approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
							</p>
                            <h4>Who should conduct a patent search?</h4>
                            <p>    	
								Typically, a patent search should be conducted by a professional patent search firm or registered patent attorney or agent who understands “class and subclass” patent searching as well as statutory requirements for patentability. All InventionHome patent searches are conducted by independent patent attorneys or agents.
							</p>
							<h3>Provisional Patent Application</h3>
                            <h4>What is a Provisional Patent Application (PPA)</h4>
                            <p>    	
								A Provisional Patent Application (PPA) is a quick, easy and cost-effective way to get your invention on file with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). A PPA enables you to establish a priority filing date for your patent, and provides 12 months of protection to further develop, market, or prepare a Utility Application. Once you file a PPA, a 12-month clock starts in which time a non-provisional patent application must be filed before the end of the 12-month provisional application period. A provisional application is not examined by the USPTO and does not automatically convert to a non-provisional patent
							</p>
							<h4>How does SourceSync simplify the application process?</h4>
                            <p>    	
								SourceSync uses a network of highly qualified patent attorneys and agents to assist our clients in filing Provisional Patent Applications at the lowest possible cost. Our streamlined system allows us to compile, edit and communicate invention information between inventors and patent attorneys / agents. Therefore we can offer a cost-effective service for preparing and filing Provisional Patent Applications.
							</p>
							<h4>What is a non-provisional patent?</h4>
                            <p>    	
								The non-provisional patent is what is traditionally thought of as the “full” patent. It can be of either a “utility” or a “design” variety, and it establishes the filing date and begins the USPTO’s patent review process. It is the only type of application that will result in the issuance of a patent, whereas, a provisional patent application acts as a placeholder for the priority date and allows you to retain “patent pending” status for your invention.
							</p>
							<h4>Why do you need a patent in the first place?</h4>
                            <p>    	
								Patents protect your idea for a limited amount of time, and prevent others from copying, making and selling your idea as their own. The patent gives you the right to make, use and sell your invention and essentially provides you with a competitive advantage or monopoly on your invention for the length of the patent term. If you do not have patent protection, your idea or invention can be quickly replicated and reproduced, without your consent. When a company licenses an invention, they are typically licensing the patent rights, not the invention itself
							</p>
							<h3>Licensing Inventions The Right Way</h3>
							<p>
								Many inventors have a great idea that they then go on to make into a machine, object , process or method. Once they create the physical object, though, many do not know what their next steps can be. Some decide to manufacture their invention themselves. For those who do not want to manufacture an invention, or do not have the means to do so, licensing inventions can be a viable and lucrative alternative.
							</p>
                            <h4>Why license an invention?</h4>
                            <p>
								You have a great invention, but either you do not want to or cannot afford to manufacture it yourself. Where do you need to be in the process to license an invention? Licensing inventions generally requires you to have  things in place: A working prototype and some sort of patent protection.
							</p>
							<h4>A Working Prototype</h4>
                            <p>
								It is difficult to get a patent without some showing that the device or invention does what is claimed. It is also hard to get a patent if no one can see that the item works. It is also hard to describe something for patenting purposes without a functioning model.
							</p>
                            <h4>What is the goa of licensing inventions?</h4>
                            <p>    	
								A licensing agreement for your invention with a reputable company. What is a Licensing Agreement? An agreement with between two parties, in this case, you the inventor and someone else who will manufacture or arrange for manufacture of the goods, where either the person manufacturing pays a fee to you, or a third party pays a fee to you, for the goods.

							<h3>How to Patent a New Invention</h3>
                            <p>
                                You have just created a brand new gadget, it’s innovative, extremely useful and everybody is dying for one. But before you can turn your new invention into millions of dollars, you need to protect it from being stolen by other would be millionaires. To do this you need a patent. But wait, you don’t have the small fortune that it sometimes takes to patent a new invention.
                            </p>
                            <p>    	
								While there is very little you can do about the filing fees that must be paid in order to patent a new invention, you can save thousands of dollars in attorney fees by applying for a patent yourself.
							</p>
							<p>
								While the patent process is not for the faint-of-heart, in most cases it it highly possible to go it alone. In fact, it is a little known truth that patent examiners at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are required by federal law to assist individuals who are applying on their own. This article discusses the basic steps you need to take to patent a new invention.
							</p>
							<h3>Patent A New Invention Basics</h3>
							<h4>Determine if your New Invention is Elgible for a Patent</h4>
                            <p>
                                To be eligible for a patent an invention must be novel. This means that it must be new and something that has not been known before. It must also be more than just an obvious improvement on what existed before, it must result from a notably inventive process. Finally, it must be able to be manufactured and do what you claim it does.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Perform a Patent Search</h4>
                            <p>
                                In order to make sure that your invention is new and has not been known before, you need to perform a patent search. A patent search is a search of all earlier developments in your field. This means a search of prior patents, domestic and foreign, as well as published literature, such as scientific and technical journals.
                            </p>   
							<p>	
								You can perform an online search of patent libraries yourself or employ a professional to do the searching for you. Either way, your application will need to address how your invention differs from any similar invention that comes up in your patent search.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Determine Which Kind of Patent Your Invention Requires</h4>
                            <p>
                                There are three categories of patents, utility patents, design patents and plant patents. Utility patents protect the functional aspects of an article, while design patents only protect an article’s aesthetic features. Design patents are cheaper and much easier to obtain than utility patents. However, utility patents offer much broader protection for your invention. Plant patents are the third category of patents and are issued for new asexually reproduced plant species.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Determine How You Want to File</h4>
                            <p>
                                There are three options for filing a patent application. You can file a provisional patent application, a non-provisional application or an international application.
                            </p>   
							<p>	
								Provisional applications are valid for 12 months and are easier and cheaper to obtain. However, you must file a non-provisional application within 12 month of filing your provisional application or risk loosing your filing date and possibly the chance to ever receive a patent on your invention.

                            <p>	
								A non-provisional patent application is the basic, full-blown patent application for new inventions in the United States and will grant the applicant 14 – 20 years of protection, depending on the type of patent granted and the filing date.
                            </p>
                            <p>	
								An international patent may be applied for via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which allows an applicant to receive patent protection in numerous countries by filing a single application, at a single patent office. Not only is this convenient, but it can save an applicant huge amounts of time and money.
                            </p>
                            <h4>File your application with the USPTO</h4>
                            <p>
                                Once you have prepared your application in the manner required by USPTO, including a description of your invention and a “claims section”, you are ready to submit your application. You may submit your application, along with the appropriate filing fee(s), through the mail or electronically through the USPTO’s electronic filing system (EFS). Filing your application via EFS is considerably cheaper than paper filings and offers various other advantages.
                            </p>

								Depending on the kind of application and the technology involved in your invention, it may take one to three years for your patent to be granted. Once it is granted, you will have the right to prevent others from making, using, selling or importing your invention, while you alone enjoy the exclusive right to profit from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>	
								Patent protection is often necessary to protect a new invention from being appropriated by others before you can exploit its financial possibilities. Though not for everyone, it is possible to save a considerable amount of money in legal fees by patenting your invention on your own. This article provides only basic information on how to patent a new invention. For more detailed instructions see the USPTO website.
